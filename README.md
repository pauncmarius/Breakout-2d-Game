# Breakout-2d-Game
Welcome to the repository where I'm crafting my own breakout game inspired by "Learn OpenGL." Here, I'm translating theory into practice, using OpenGL to bring my vision to life. With each line of code, I'm exploring the depths of graphics programming, turning concepts into tangible creations. This repository isn't just a collection of filesâ€”it's a journey of learning, creativity, and mastery. Join me as I navigate the exciting world of modern OpenGL, one commit at a time.
