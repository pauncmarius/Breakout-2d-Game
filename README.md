# Breakout-2d-Game
Welcome to the repository where I'm crafting my own breakout game inspired by the book "Learn OpenGL: Learn modern OpenGL graphics programming in a step-by-step fashion". Here, I'm translating theory into practice, using OpenGL to bring my vision to life. With each line of code, I'm exploring the depths of graphics programming, turning concepts into tangible creations. This repository is a collection of files, where i put all the effort i could to make a playable game with basic opengl features.

# Implementation section
The Breakout 2D game is implemented in C++ using OpenGL for rendering. The project is structured around classes for Game, GameObject, Paddle, Ball, Brick, and Level. The Game class handles initialization, input processing, updates, and rendering. All visible objects inherit from GameObject and use textures and shaders for rendering. Collision detection ensures realistic bouncing of the ball against walls, paddle, and bricks. Levels are defined using brick layouts, allowing multiple stages. The game loop processes input, updates the game state, and renders each frame continuously, providing a smooth 2D arcade gameplay experience.
