# Breakout-2d-Game
Welcome to the repository where I'm crafting my own breakout game inspired by the book "Learn OpenGL: Learn modern OpenGL graphics programming in a step-by-step fashion". Here, I'm translating theory into practice, using OpenGL to bring my vision to life. With each line of code, I'm exploring the depths of graphics programming, turning concepts into tangible creations. This repository is a collection of files, where i put all the effort i could to make a playable game with basic opengl features.
